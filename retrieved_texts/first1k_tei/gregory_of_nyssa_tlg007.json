This is indeed to\nincur a πενία, unknown to the faithful\nfollowers τοῦ ἡμετέρου λόγου.\nGr.'s conception of the\n’all attainable to the individual,\nnot successively, but by walking\nsimultaneously along many roads\nwhich lead to them, is a conception\ndifficult to grasp, but suggestive of\na noble fulness of living energy.\nib. ὠθεῖσθε] ‘crowd along,' ’ force\nyour way in a herd'; heard';\n73 ὠθεῖσθ’ ὥσπερ ὕες.\n7. ἀδολ. κ. τερατείας] ‘Αδολεσχία\nis ’idle ’: Elias explains\nτερατεία by τὸ πλάττειν ἄτοπά τε\nκαὶ ἀλλόκοτα, ’saying extraordinary\nthings to electrify ’ Cp. Ar.\nNub. 418. The verb τερατεύεσθαι\ncomes below in ἑ 10.\n8. ἀπαρίθμησιν] ‘enumeration. ’\n1 Cor. xii 29. It is a little strange\nthat Gr. should select a passage\nwhere St Paul is insisting on the\nlimitation of spiritual gifts, and their\nassignment to the various members\nof the Church, instead of being accumulated\nupon each. But prob.\nGr. does not concern himself with\nthe context of the passage, and intends\nthe ’rebuke’ to apply to the\nδιαλεκτικὸς inasmuch as he gives\nhimself the airs of an ‘ apostle ’ or a\n‘prophet. ’\n9. ἐν οἶς φησι] ‘where he ’\nIt seems best not to make χαρισμάτων\nthe antecedent of οἷς.\n9. However exalted you may be\nyourself, you cannot make other\npeople theologians suddenly. That,\nhowever, is what you profess to do,\nand then you crowed Councils with\nthe conceited rabble that you have\ncollected.\n11. ὠτῶ δέ· ὁ. σὺ] Assuming\nthat you have the gifts which you\nimagine, why do you make such a\nbad use of them ? In ὑψ. πέρα it is\ndoubtful whether ὑψ. is neut. or\nmasc., ’beyond the heights ,’ or 'be-\nyond the high ones.’\n\n\nἀρρήτων ἀκροατής, ὁ μετὰ Ἠλίαν μετάρσιος, καὶ ὁ μετὰ\nΜωυσέα θεοφανείας ἠξιωμένος, καὶ μετὰ Παῦλον οὐράνιος·\nτί καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους αὐθήμερον, πλάττεις ἁγίους, καὶ χειροτονεῖς\nθεολόγους, καὶ οἷον ἐμπνεῖς τὴν παίδευσιν, καὶ\n πεποίηκας λογίων ἀμαθῶν πολλὰ συνέδρια; τί τοῖς ἀραχνίοις\nὑφάσμασιν ἐνδεσμεῖς τοὺς ἀσθενεστέρους, ὡς δή τι\nσοφὸν καὶ μέγα; τί σφηκιὰς ἐγείρεις κατὰ τῆς πίστεως;\nτί σχεδιάζεις ἡμῖν διαλεκτικῶν ἀνάδοσιν, ὥσπερ οἱ μῦθοι\n9. 1 και ο μετα] και μετα c || 6 om υφασμασιν ad ‘duo Reg. duo\nColb.

Μωυσέα θ. ἠξ.] Ex. xxxiv 6.\n3. αὐθήμερον πλ. ἁγίους] It is\nassumed, from their setting up as\ntheologians, that they have passed\nthrough the moral discipline which\nGr. requires before so doing (p. 4\nsupra); but the discipline must have\nbeen hurried through ‘all in a day?’\nib. χειροτονεῖς θ....ἐμπνεῖς τ. π.]\nThe same thought carried on. These\nmen’s theology has come to them,\nnot by long study and careful training,\nbut by a touch or a breath.\nXειρ. prob. alludes to the act of\nlaying on of hands in Ordination,\nthough Gr. does not necessarily\nimply that the men had been actually\nordained. The word, however, may\nperh. only mean ‘elect?,’ ‘appoint.’\nIn either case the process is characterized\nas both arbitrary and sudden .\n4. ἐμπνεῖς] Elias supposes a ref.\nto such passages as Gen. ii 7 or Job\nxxvii 3. If the allusion to ordination\nin χειρ. were secure, it would\nbe natural to connect ἐμπν. with John\nxx 22 (ἐνεφύσησεν). There is no\nevidence, however, that any ceremony\nof breathing was used in Gr.’s\ntime in ordaining; and it seems\nsimpler to regard the word as denoting\nonly a quick and miraculous\nway of imparting the knowledge of\ndivine things.\n5. π. συνέδρια] So equipped,\nthe theologians pass to those ‘multitudinous\ncouncils’ which were the\nchief feature of Church History in\nthe fourth century. Gr., as is well\nknown, had no high opinion of\ncouncils at the best (Stanley Eastern\nChurch p. 74). Λογίων points both\nto the assurance with which these\nmen spoke, and to the source of their\ninspiration (ἐμπνεῖς).\n6. ἐνδεσμεῖς] a rare word; ‘to\nput in bonds.’ The ‘spider’s webs’\nare of course the dogmatic subtleties\nby which they entangle weak opponents.\nCp. Orat. xxv § 18.\n7. σφηκιάς] He does not seem\nto refer again to the heathen; it is\nthe heretics themselves who swarm\nout against the faith,—the same who\nare described in the next sentence as\nδιαλ. ἀνάδοσιν.\n8. σχεδιάζεις] The verb denotes\nwhat is hastily prepared out of the\nfirst materials that come to hand,\n‘to improvise.’ It thus returns to\nthe accusation that Gr.’s opponents\nhad had no proper training.\nib. δ. ἀνάδοσιν] Ἀναδίδωμι is to\n‘yield,’ as the earth yields a crop, or\nthe spring a volume of water. Thuc.\niii 88 uses it of Aetna, πῦρ κ. καπνὸν\nἀναδ. So ἀνάδοσις is an ‘output’ or\n‘outburst.’ Διαλεκτικῶν of course is\nmasc., ‘dialecticians.’\nib. οἱ μ....τ. γίγαντας] Α contracted expression; ‘as the old fables did with the giants,’ meaning, ‘as the old fables said that the Earth brought forth the giants.’ It the metaphor of ἀνάδοσιν. The giants, however, are referred to not only because they sprang out of the Earth, but because they waged war upon the gods.\n\n\nπάλαι τοὺς γίγαντας; τί τῶν ἀνδρῶν ὅσον κοῦφον καὶ\nἄνανδρον, ὥσπερ τινὰ συρφετόν, εἰς μίαν χαράδραν συναγαγών,\nκαὶ κολακείᾳ πλέον θηλύνας, καινὸν ἀσεβείας ἐργαστήριον\nἐδημιούργησας, οὐκ ἀσόφως τὴν ἄνοιαν αὐτῶν\nἐκκαρπούμενος; Ἀντιλέγεις καὶ τούτοις; καὶ οὐδαμοῦ σοι τἄλλα; καὶ\nτὴν γλῶσσαν δεῖ δυναστεύειν πάντως, καὶ οὐ κατέχεις τὴν\nὠδῖνα τοῦ λόγου; ἔχεις καὶ ἄλλας ὑποθέσεις πολλάς τε\nκαὶ φιλοτίμους. ἐκεῖ τρέψον μετὰ τοῦ χρησίμου τὴν νόσον.\n10. βάλλε μοι Πυθαγόρου τὴν σιωπήν, καὶ τοὺς κυάμους \n1 om τι των ανδρων . . . εκκαρπουμενος acd\n1. τῶν ἀνδρῶν ὅσον κ.] ‘everything\nthat is worthless in the shape\nof men.’\n2. συρφετόν] like περίψημα, ‘offscourings,’\n‘sweepings.’\nib. χαράδραν] may be either the\n‘torrent’; itself, or the ‘channel,’\nnatural or artificial, down which it\npours. Here perh. the former is\nthe simplest; the ‘offscourings’ form\na ‘torrent’; but the metaphors are\nsomewhat entangled.\n3. κολακείᾳ] They were ἄνανδροι\nto begin with; and the flattery which\nthey receive from their leaders makes\nthem worse.\nib. καιν. ἀσεβ. ἐργαστ. ἐδημ.] ‘you\nhave created a strange kind of manufactory.’\nThe heretical leaders have\nset up in business, as it were; their\nplant and factory consisting of their\ndupes. The stress of the sentence\ndoes not lie on the products of the\nἐργ. (i.e. ἀσεβείας), but on the fact\nthat the leaders make a living by it.\n5. ἐκκαρπούμενος] ‘profiting by.’\n10. If you cannot be silent, turn\nyour argumentative powers to use by\nrefuting the various schools of heathen\nphilosophy, the absurdities of heathen\nworship and magic. Or if you prefer\nsomething more original and constructive,\ngive us a philosophy of\nyour own, or speak of points of\nChristian doctrine where there is no\ngreat harm done if a mistake is\nmade.\n6. καὶ τούτοις] i.e. as you oppose\neverything else that we say. Cp.\nthe beginning of the sermon.\nib. οὐδαμοῦ σ. τἄλλα] ‘Do you\ncare for nothing else?,’ i.e. than\ntalking, and talking controversially.\n7. δυναστεύειν] not here over\nothers, but over the man himself.\nHis tongue is his tyrant.\nib. τὴν ὠδῖνα τ. λ.] Cp. the\nsomewhat similar image in Job xxxii\n18 foll.\n8. ὑποθέσεις] ‘subjects,’ ‘themes’;\nLat. argumenta.\n9. φιλοτίμους] We too transfer\nthe epithet ‘ambitious’ to the subject\nfrom the man who deals with it.\nBut the usage does not occur commonly\nin Greek.\n10. βάλλε] ‘strike.’ The unsympathetic\nattitude here assumed\ntowards the schools of Greek philosophy\ndoes not represent the whole\nmind of Gr. and his friends. It is\nonly assumed for a rhetorical purpose.\nib. τὴν σιωπήν] “The Pythagorean\nschool is represented to us not merely\nas a scientific association, but also,\nand principally, as a religious and\npolitical society. Entrance into it\nwas only to be obtained by a strict\nprobation, and on condition of several\nyears’ silence.\" “The duration\nthe silent noviciate is variously\ngiven.’’ Zeller Pre-Socratic\nI p. 342 (Engl. Transl.), where\nthis ref. of Gr. may be added to\nthose given by Zeller.\n\n\nτοὺς Ὀρφικούς, καὶ τὴν περὶ τὸ Αὐτὸς ἔφα καινοτέραν\nἀλαζονείαν. βάλλε μοι Πλάτωνος τὰς ἰδέας, καὶ τὰς\nμετενσωματώσεις καὶ περιόδους τῶν ἡμετέρων ψυχῶν, καὶ\nτὰς ἀναμνήσεις, καὶ τοὺς οὐ καλοὺς διὰ τῶν καλῶν σωμάτων\n ἐπὶ ψυχὴν ἔρωτας· Ἐπικούρου τὴν ἀθείαν, καὶ τὰς\n1. τοὺς κυάμους τ.

This... enjoined\n. . . entire abstinence from . . .\nanimal food, from beans and some\nother kinds of nourishment.’’\nop. cit. p. 343 f. “Whether\nordinances,\" he adds, \"originated\nwith the Italian Pythagoreans, or\nonly belong to the later Orphics of\nPythagorean tendencies; whether\nconsequently they arose from Pythagoreanism\nor from the Orphic\nmysteries, we do not certainly know.\"\nZeller speaks of ‘the early connexion\nof Pythagoreanism with the Bacchic\nOrphic mysteries\" (p. 347, first\nnote).\nib. Αὐτὸς ἔφα] “ They rigorously\nmaintained the doctrine of their\nmaster, and silenced all pposition\nwith the famous dictum αὐτὸς ἔφα”:\nZeller p. 350. Gr. calls this κ. ἀλαζ.\n‘an extraordinary piece of swagger.’\n2. τὰς ἰδέας] “Plato. . .defines\nthe Idea as that which is common\nto the Many of like name...This\nUniversal he conceives as separate\nfrom the world of Phenomena, —as\nabsolutely existing Substance...The\nIdeas stand as the eternal prototypes\nof Being —all other things are copied\nfrom them\"; \"archetypes, according\nto which Divine Reason fashioned\nthe world ”: Zeller Plato and the\nOlder Academy pp. 239 foil., 244.\n3. μετενσωματώσεις κ. περιόδους]\n‘his tran sincorporations and circulations\nof our souls.’ See Zeller\ncit. ch. ix. “At their first birth, all\n[souls]...are implanted in human,\nand male, bodies; only their lots\nvary according to their merit. After\ndeath, all are judged, and placed for\na thousand years, some as a punishment\nunder the earth, some as a\nreward in heaven. This period\nhaving elapsed, they have again to\nchoose,—the evil as well as the\n—a new kind of life; and in this\nchoice, human souls pass into beasts,\nor from beasts back into human\nbodies’’ (p. 393).\n4. ἀναμνήσεις] Plato taught that\nour souls bring with them into their\nearthly existence knowledge acquired\nin a previous state of existence. “If\n...concepts and cognitions [of an\nuniversal kind] are given us before\nany presentation has been appropriated,\nwe cannot have acquired them\nin this life, but must have brought\nthem with us from a previous life.\nThe facts of learning and of conceptual\nknowledge are only to be\nexplained by the pre-existence of\nthe soul. ” Zeller p. 395.\n5. ἐπὶ ψυχήν] ‘directed to,’\nas far as,’ and so ‘ concerned\nthe soul,’ i.e. of the beloved,\nit may profess to be unconcerned with\nthe body. \"Love...is realised in a\ngraduated series of different forms.\nThe first is the love of beautiful\nshapes,—of one, and then of all:\nhigher step is the love of beautiful\nsouls, which operates in moral words\nand efforts, in works of education,\nart, and legislation: a third is the\nlove of beautiful sciences,\" etc.:\nZeller p. 194; cp.

See Zeller Stoics, Epicureans,\nand Sceptics p. 464 foil.\n1. ἀτόμους] Epicurus, whose view\nof the universe was purely meterialistic,\ntaught the eternal existence of\nthose \"primary component parts of\nthings\" which he called ’atoms.’\nSee Zeller op. cit. p. 439 foil.\nib. ἡδονήν] \"The only unconditional\ngood, according to Epicurus,\nis pleasure; the only unconditional\nevil is pain\": Zeller p. 473.
