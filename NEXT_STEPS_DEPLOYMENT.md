## Immediate Next Steps (30 minutes)

### Step 1: Build the Frontend (5 minutes)

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

**What this does:** Creates optimized production files in `frontend/dist/`

**Expected output:**
```
‚úì 1547 modules transformed.
dist/index.html                   1.2 kB
dist/assets/index-[hash].css     45.3 kB
dist/assets/index-[hash].js     823.1 kB
‚úì built in 12.34s
```

### Step 2: Test Locally (5 minutes)

```bash
npm run preview
```

**What this does:** Runs a local server with production build

**Open:** http://localhost:4173/visualizer

**Test checklist:**
- [ ] Graph loads without errors
- [ ] Click a node ‚Üí detail panel slides in from right
- [ ] Top-left controls panel opens/closes
- [ ] Top-right export menu appears
- [ ] Press 'H' ‚Üí help overlay appears
- [ ] Try filtering node types
- [ ] Export as PNG works
- [ ] Copy citation button works

### Step 3: Deploy to Production (20 minutes)

You mentioned free-will.app is already deployed. Here are your options:

#### Option A: Deploy via Vercel (Recommended - Easiest)

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI (if not already installed)
npm install -g vercel

# Navigate to frontend
cd frontend

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

Follow prompts:
- Link to existing project or create new? ‚Üí **Link to existing**
- Which project? ‚Üí **Select your EleutherIA project**
- Override settings? ‚Üí **No**

**Result:** Updates your live site in ~2 minutes

#### Option B: Deploy via Netlify

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Navigate to frontend
cd frontend

# Build
npm run build

# Deploy
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

#### Option C: Manual Upload (if using traditional hosting)

1. Build: `npm run build`
2. Upload everything in `frontend/dist/` to your web server
3. Ensure `index.html` is served for `/visualizer` route

Subject: EleutherIA Update: Enhanced Visualization Features

Dear [Advisor name],

I wanted to update you on recent developments with EleutherIA.

I've implemented a suite of UX enhancements to the knowledge graph visualizer, bringing the interface quality on par with major ERC-funded digital humanities projects like ATLOMY.

Key additions:
- Interactive filtering and multiple layout algorithms
- Export tools for publications (PNG, SVG, bibliography generation)
- Rich node detail panels with one-click citations
- Keyboard shortcuts for efficient navigation

These features significantly enhance the database's utility for researchers while maintaining our commitment to open access and FAIR principles.
