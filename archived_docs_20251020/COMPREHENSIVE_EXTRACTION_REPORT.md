## Appendix: Sample Extractions

### A. High-Quality Greek Extraction (Dihle 1982)

**Text:**
> τὸ ἐφ' ἡμῖν καὶ τὸ αὐτεξούσιον

**Transliteration:**
> to eph' hêmin kai to autexousion

**Translation:**
> "what is in our power and self-determination"

**Context:**
> Discussion of the transition from Stoic terminology (ἐφ' ἡμῖν) to Christian innovation (αὐτεξούσιον) in the Patristic period.

**Modern Scholarship:**
> Dihle argues this represents a fundamental shift in how freedom was conceptualized, from "up to us" (Aristotelian-Stoic) to "self-determining power" (Christian).

### B. Structured Argument (Bobzien 2001)

**Argument:** Cylinder and Cone Analogy (Chrysippus)

**Premises:**
1. A cylinder and cone, when pushed, roll according to their own natures
2. The external push is the antecedent cause (starting the motion)
3. The shape (nature) is the principal cause (determining how it rolls)
4. Similarly, impressions are antecedent causes of assent
5. But assent depends on the soul's nature, not just the impression

**Conclusion:**
Therefore, we can have causal determinism (all events have antecedent causes) while preserving "what is up to us" (our assents depend on our nature).

**Proponent:** Chrysippus
**Period:** Hellenistic Greek (3rd c. BCE)
**Source:** Cicero, De Fato 42-43
**Modern Discussion:** Bobzien 2001, pp. 258-274

### C. Debate Identification (Brouwer 2020)

**Debate:** Stoic-Middle Platonist Dialogue on Providence and Freedom

**Participants:**
- Stoics (Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius)
- Middle Platonists (Plutarch, Alcinous, Apuleius)

**Central Question:**
Can divine providence govern all events without eliminating human freedom and moral responsibility?

**Stoic Position:**
Yes - providence and fate are compatible with "what depends on us" because our assents are part of the causal chain but still "up to us."

**Platonist Position:**
Partially - providence guides the cosmos, but matter introduces contingency and human souls have genuine freedom of choice.

**Historical Context:**
Early Imperial period (1st-2nd c. CE), shift from Hellenistic debates to religious-philosophical synthesis.

**Modern Scholarship:**
Brouwer & Vimercati (2020) argue this dialogue prepared the ground for Christian Patristic synthesis.
