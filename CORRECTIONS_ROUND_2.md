## NEW CORRECTIONS NEEDED

### 1. IRENAEUS ARGUMENT (argument_irenaeuss_antignostic_argument_for_free_will_f54fe920)

**CRITICAL: DUPLICATE SOURCES**

**Current ancient_sources:**
```
"Irenaeus, Adversus Haereses IV.37-39 (Against Heresies - on human freedom and obedience)"
"Irenaeus, Adversus Haereses IV.37-39 (Against Heresies - on human freedom and obedience)"
"Irenaeus, Epideixis (Demonstration of the Apostolic Preaching) 11, 15"
"Irenaeus, Adversus Haereses IV.37-39 (Against Heresies - on human freedom and obedience)"
```

**PROBLEM:** Adversus Haereses IV.37-39 listed THREE TIMES

**ACTION:**
- Remove 2 duplicate entries
- Verify if Epideixis 11, 15 discusses free will (uncertain - may be general Christian teaching)
- Consider removing Epideixis if not specifically about free will

---

### 2. CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA (person_clement_of_alexandria_4s9t1v87)

**Current ancient_sources:**
```
"Clement of Alexandria, Stromata (Miscellanies)"
"Clement of Alexandria, Protrepticus (Exhortation to the Greeks)"
```

**PROBLEM:** Protrepticus is general apologetic work exhorting conversion

**ACTION:**
- KEEP: Stromata (does discuss free will and providence)
- UNCERTAIN: Protrepticus (primarily apologetics, not focused on free will)
- Recommend removing Protrepticus unless verified

---

### 3. HIEROCLES OF ALEXANDRIA (person_hierocles_of_alexandria_1p6q8s54)

**Current ancient_sources:**
```
"Photius, Bibliotheca cod. 214, 251 (summaries of Hierocles' lost work)"
"Aeneas of Gaza mentions Hierocles"
```

**PROBLEM:** "Aeneas of Gaza mentions Hierocles" is TOO VAGUE

**ACTION:**
- KEEP: Photius Bibliotheca cod. 214, 251 (legitimate source)
- REMOVE: "Aeneas of Gaza mentions Hierocles" (lacks specificity - which work? where? what context?)

---

### 4. CAESARIUS OF ARLES (person_caesarius_arles_d542)

**Current ancient_sources:**
```
"Caesarius of Arles, Sermons"
"Acts of Council of Orange (529 CE) - Caesarius presided"
```

**PROBLEM:** "Sermons" is too general

**ACTION:**
- REMOVE or SPECIFY: "Caesarius of Arles, Sermons" (which sermons? need specific sermon numbers on grace/free will)
- KEEP: Acts of Council of Orange (529 CE) - addresses Semi-Pelagianism

---

### 5. VINCENT OF LÉRINS (person_vincent_lerins_d450)

**Current ancient_sources:**
```
"Vincent of Lérins, Commonitorium (c. 434 CE)"
```

**PROBLEM:** Commonitorium is about identifying true doctrine, not specifically about grace/free will

**ACTION:**
- UNCERTAIN: Commonitorium may not be directly about free will debates
- Recommend removing unless verified that it discusses grace/free will

---

## VERIFIED AS GOOD

**FAUSTUS OF RIEZ:**
- ✅ Faustus of Riez, De Gratia (On Grace) - directly on grace/free will
- ✅ Fulgentius of Ruspe, Contra Faustum - refutation of his views

---
