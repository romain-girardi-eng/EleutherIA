  This knowledge graph represents the first comprehensive digital mapping
  of ancient free will debates in Greco-Roman and early Christian philosophy
  and theology. It covers 8 historical phases spanning from Aristotle (4th c. BCE)
  to Boethius (6th c. CE), documenting the evolution of concepts like eph' hêmin
  (in our power), heimarmenê (fate), and autexousion (self-determining power).
  The database includes 465 nodes (persons, works, concepts, arguments) with
  745 interconnecting edges, representing the major philosophical and theological
  positions: Aristotelian voluntariness, Stoic compatibilism, Epicurean
  indeterminism, Academic incompatibilism, Middle Platonist synthesis, and
  Christian libertarianism. All entries include ancient source citations,
  modern scholarship references, and Greek/Latin terminology. Based on
  comprehensive doctoral research with 200+ bibliography references.
