## MINOR AREAS FOR POTENTIAL ENHANCEMENT

### 1. Descriptions (13 concept nodes)
**Current:** 13 Patristic Latin concept nodes lack descriptions
**Impact:** MINOR - they have terminology and English terms
**Examples:** Gratia Praeveniens, Theosis, Original Sin
**Recommendation:** Could add brief descriptions for completeness

### 2. Reception Concept Terminology
**Current:** Reception concepts have Latin/Greek in labels but not in structured fields
**Impact:** MINOR - terminology is present, just not in separate fields
**Recommendation:** Acceptable given ancient focus of database

### 3. Contemporary Concept Sources (4 nodes)
**Current:** 4 very modern concepts lack sources
**Impact:** MINOR - they're 20th-21st century analytical concepts
**Examples:** Reactive Attitudes, Frankfurt Cases, Consequence Argument, Semicompatibilism
**Recommendation:** Could add modern_scholarship for completeness

### 4. Reformulation Sources
**Current:** 53 reformulation nodes lack explicit sources
**Impact:** ACCEPTABLE - reformulations are documented via graph structure
**Recommendation:** No action needed - graph edges capture relationships
