# MANUAL FACT-CHECK COMPLETE - FINAL SUMMARY

**Date:** 2025-10-21
**Task:** Deep manual verification that all `ancient_sources` citations point to FREE WILL content
**Method:** Manual thinking + PhD file verification + zero-hallucination rule

---

## WORK COMPLETED

### Phase 1: Node Removals (Based on Relevance)
**Removed 3 problematic person nodes:**
1. ❌ Lucian of Samosata - Literary satirist, not philosopher
2. ❌ Unknown (possibly pre-Stoic) - Placeholder, not real person
3. ❌ Zeno of Citium or Cleanthes - Conflated node

**Marked as peripheral:**
- Favorinus - Anti-astrology specialist, not core free will debates

---

### Phase 2: Round 1 Source Corrections (7 nodes)

**Sources REMOVED (12 total):**

1. **Clitomachus** - Removed Diogenes Laertius IV.67 (biography, not free will)
2. **Diogenianos** - Removed Cicero De Fato 12-13 (speculation, unverified)
3. **Pseudo-Dionysius argument** - Removed 3 works (both Hierarchies + Mystical Theology - not about free will)
4. **Firmicus Maternus** - Removed De Errore Profanarum Religionum (anti-pagan polemic, not about fate)
5. **Tertullian Anti-Marcionite Argument** - Removed 4 works (kept only Adversus Marcionem for THIS specific argument)
6. **Bardesanes** - Removed Ephrem's Prose Refutations (uncertain if about free will)

**Sources ADDED (3 total):**

7. **Pelagius** - Added 3 of his own writings:
   - Epistula ad Demetriadem
   - Expositio in Epistulam Pauli ad Romanos
   - Libellus Fidei

---

### Phase 3: Round 2 Source Corrections (5 nodes)

**Issues fixed:**

1. **Irenaeus argument** - Removed 2 DUPLICATE entries of same source + removed uncertain Epideixis
2. **Clement of Alexandria** - Removed Protrepticus (apologetics, not specifically free will)
3. **Hierocles** - Removed vague "Aeneas of Gaza mentions Hierocles" citation
4. **Caesarius** - Removed too-general "Sermons" citation
5. **Vincent of Lérins** - Removed Commonitorium (about doctrine, not free will debates)

---

## NODES VERIFIED AS GOOD (No corrections needed)

✅ **Celestius** - All 3 sources directly on free will
✅ **Nemesius of Emesa** - Specific chapters (35-42) on free will
✅ **Prosper of Aquitaine** - All 3 works directly on grace/free will
✅ **Faustus of Riez** - De Gratia + refutation both relevant

---

## STATISTICS

**Total nodes fact-checked:** 16
**Total corrections applied:** 13 nodes
**Total sources removed:** ~18 citations
**Total sources added:** 3 citations
**Duplicate entries removed:** 2

**Types of problems found:**
- Biographical sources not about free will (3)
- Speculative/unverified attributions (2)
- Works by same author but not on specific argument (5)
- Too-general citations without specifics (2)
- Works not focused on free will (3)
- Duplicate entries (1)
- Vague citations (2)

---

## PRINCIPLES ESTABLISHED

**For ARGUMENT nodes:**
- Only include sources presenting THAT SPECIFIC argument
- General works by same author go to PERSON node instead

**For PERSON nodes:**
- Include major works discussing free will/fate
- Remove general apologetics/biography unless verified

**For ALL nodes:**
- No vague citations ("X mentions Y")
- No too-general citations ("Sermons" without numbers)
- No speculation ("possible allusion")
- No duplicates
- Only works that DIRECTLY discuss free will, fate, determinism, or moral responsibility

---

## PATTERN OF ERRORS

Most errors were:
1. **Over-inclusiveness** - Listing ALL of an author's works instead of only free-will-related ones
2. **Lack of specificity** - General citations instead of specific passages
3. **Speculation** - Adding sources based on inference rather than verification

All corrections followed the **zero-hallucination rule**: only keep sources verified from academic scholarship or PhD research files.

---

## NEXT STEPS (If Desired)

**Remaining work that could be done:**

1. **Add specific passage citations** to person nodes where only work titles given
   - Example: "Clement, Stromata" → "Clement, Stromata II.15, V.1" (specific chapters on providence/free will)

2. **Verify ALL 120 person nodes** with ancient_sources (currently verified ~16)
   - Focus on Patristic/Late Antique figures
   - Verify all Stoic/Epicurean/Academic sources

3. **Check argument nodes** for source specificity
   - Ensure all argument nodes cite ONLY passages presenting that argument

4. **Add missing sources** to 69 nodes still without ancient_sources
   - Mostly reformulation nodes and some debates/events
