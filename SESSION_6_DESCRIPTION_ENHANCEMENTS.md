## REMAINING OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS

### Minor Areas for Future Enhancement (Not Critical):

1. **Contemporary Concept Sources (4 nodes)**
   - Reactive Attitudes, Frankfurt Cases, Consequence Argument, Semicompatibilism
   - Could add modern_scholarship references
   - **Impact:** MINOR - these are 20th-21st century analytical concepts

2. **Reception Concept Terminology**
   - Reception concepts have Latin/Greek in labels but not structured fields
   - Could add separate terminology fields
   - **Impact:** MINOR - terminology is present, just not in separate fields

3. **Additional Passage Citations**
   - Could add more specific passage citations to some person nodes
   - **Impact:** MINOR - existing citations are already academically sound

**Status:** These are truly optional - database is publication-ready without them.
