- **Accents**: Soft green palette (#8baf9f, #c5d7cf, #a8c3b7)

### Typography
- **Georgia serif** for all primary text (academic, readable)
- **Palatino serif** for Greek/Latin terms (classical feel)
- Proper Unicode Greek characters (ἐφ' ἡμῖν, ἑκούσιον, Ἐλευθερία)

### Visual Style
- Soft shadows for elevation (professional depth)
- Rounded corners (8-12px radius)

## 🎬 Next Steps for Video Production

The complete storyboard is ready for production! You have two options:

### Option A: DIY Production (20-40 hours, $0-200)
**Recommended tools**:
1. **Manim** (Python) - Best for technical/academic animations
   - Free, open-source
   - Programmatic control
   - Perfect for mathematical/graph visualizations
   - Learning curve: Medium

2. **Remotion** (React/TypeScript) - Modern programmatic video
   - Familiar if you know React
