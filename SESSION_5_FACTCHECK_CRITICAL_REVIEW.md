## ⚠️ POTENTIAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### 1. Aquinas's Intellectualism - Oversimplification?
**Claim in database:** "The will necessarily follows the intellect's presentation of the good"

**Concern:** This may be too strong. Aquinas holds:
- Will NECESSARILY wills happiness (universal good) - I-II, q.1, a.6
- Will is FREE regarding particular goods - I-II, q.10, a.2
- The necessity is NOT absolute but conditional on intellect's judgment

**ACTION:** Need to verify exact wording doesn't misrepresent Aquinas

---

### 2. Citation Format Check Needed
**Current format:** "Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologica I-II, q.1, a.6 (necessity of willing happiness)"

**Standard academic format:** Should be:
- "Thomas Aquinas, *Summa Theologiae* I-II, q.1, a.6"
- Note: "Theologiae" not "Theologica" in Latin title
- Note: Italicized title

**ACTION:** Check if "Summa Theologica" vs. "Summa Theologiae" matters

## 🚨 HIGH-PRIORITY ISSUES TO INVESTIGATE

### Issue 1: MacDonald (1998) "Libertarian Account" vs. Intellectualism
**Citation:** "MacDonald, S. (1998). 'Aquinas's Libertarian Account of Free Choice'. *Revue Internationale de Philosophie* 52(204): 309-328."

**Problem:** The title says "libertarian" but the argument is about intellectualism (usually considered compatibilist or soft determinism).

**Possible explanations:**
1. MacDonald argues Aquinas IS libertarian (contra standard reading)
2. The title is correct but the article argues against libertarian reading
3. I misremembered or hallucinated the citation

**ACTION REQUIRED:** ⚠️ **CRITICAL** - Must verify this citation exists and is correctly applied

---

### Issue 2: Buridan's Ass - Attribution Problem
**Claim in database:** "While popularly attributed to Jean Buridan (14th c.), the paradox does not appear explicitly in Buridan's extant works."

**Status:** This is CORRECT as stated - I acknowledged the attribution problem.

**BUT:** Need to verify:
- Does Aristotle *De Caelo* II.13 at 295b discuss "man equally hungry and thirsty"? ⏸️
- Does Dante *Paradiso* IV.1-6 discuss "lamb between two wolves"? ⏸️
- Does Buridan discuss it in *Quaestiones in Ethica* III, q.1? ⏸️

---

### Issue 3: Five Jansenist Propositions
**Claim:** Pope Innocent X condemned five propositions from *Augustinus* in 1653 (bull *Cum Occasione*)

**Need to verify:**
1. Correct Pope (Innocent X)? ⏸️
2. Correct year (1653)? ⏸️
3. Correct bull name (*Cum Occasione*)? ⏸️
4. Are the five propositions accurately summarized? ⏸️

## ✅ NEXT STEPS

1. **IMMEDIATE:** Verify MacDonald (1998) citation (potential hallucination risk)
2. **HIGH PRIORITY:** Check all 5 persons' birth/death dates against reliable sources
3. **HIGH PRIORITY:** Verify key primary source citations (Summa, Ordinatio, etc.)
4. **MEDIUM PRIORITY:** Check modern scholarship citations for accuracy

## 📝 NOTES

- **Philosophy is complex:** Some claims may be defensible interpretations even if not universally accepted
- **Distinguish:** Errors vs. contested interpretations vs. simplifications
- **Priority:** Factual errors (dates, citations) > philosophical oversimplifications
- **Standard:** Zero tolerance for hallucinated citations; some tolerance for reasonable scholarly disagreement on interpretation
